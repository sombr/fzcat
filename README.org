* fzcat
Fast zcat with [[http://linux.die.net/man/3/mmap][mmap]] and [[https://code.google.com/p/miniz/][miniz]]

The goal of this project is to release a program that behaves like zcat but faster for multiple files.

* How is it faster
First, miniz is a blazing fast implementation of zlib. Second, instead of using [[http://linux.die.net/man/3/open][open]] and [[http://linux.die.net/man/3/read][read]] we use [[http://linux.die.net/man/3/mmap][mmap]] and pipe that directly into miniz. Then we take the output written to a buffer and write it directly to stdout. This reduces the number of times the memory is copied around, increasing the performance.

* How fast is it

* When is it not faster

* Compiling
You will need a C++ compiler that support C++14. I'd highly recommend the latest version of [[http://clang.llvm.org/][Clang]].
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  premake4 gmake
  make config=static
#+END_SRC

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  fzcat [<file1> [<file2> [<file3>...] ] ]
#+END_SRC
